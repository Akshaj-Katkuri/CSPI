Things to keep in mind for later, just incase I forget to account for it: 

Variables: 
 - including expressions when assigning a variable gives an error. Ex: VAR a = (5 + 6) gives an error saying it can't convert '6)' into an int. 
 - You can declare variables while declaring other variables. Ex: VAR a = VAR b = 7 gives both 'a' and 'b' the value 7. This works without the keyword 'VAR' too. 

Error: 
 - Bad error messages for comparisn expressions
 - Bad error message when this: a + +
 - Bad error messages throughout rlly
 - Very rare incorrect error message: when you use statements in an expr (ex: repeat-expr), and you have multiple lines and the error is in later lines, incorrect error message. But the line is correct though. 

WHILE and FOR loops: 
 - Currently FOR and WHILE loops return list by default. Check if we want to change that.

If statements: 
 - For some reason, if in the interpreter in visit_ifnode, the condition_value is somehow becoming a type Number. There is a tiny workaround for this as even if Number is storing a bool value for some reason, the function.is_true() works. 

Lexer: 
 - Change lexing process to how POW is done for all comparisn operators. 

Function: 
 - Change function syntax to make Identifier necessary. 

List: 
 - Change list indexing to start from 0 or 1 (check reference sheet)
 - Concatenate list using + and not *
 - Remove + and / operators for list
 - Make * operator multiply list that many times (how python does it)
 - Change how to get an element from the list
 - Built in list functions 
 - Make printing a list print the square brackets too
 - Fix lists not working with comparisn operators

Built-in Functions: 
 - Check if we want input_int (removed), or add int() function, or auto convert to int if possible. 
 - Test all the built-in functions

Robot: 
 - Throws a small error randomly when you run a command. This is because for a split second as the .json file is being updated, it doesn't have a char for the turtle for a split second in which it gets confused. 

Comments: 
 - in skip_comment(), if a comment is on a single line with no new line, then while loop will keep calling advance() indefinitely since no new line found
 - in the event that there is a comment that is the only comment in the file with no code following after it, the program detects an empty line as an invalid syntax which throws a confusing error. This error has less to do with the comment function and more to do with the program not ignoring an empty line

Grid: 
 - can_move() is returning true even with a wall ahead. 
 - Move all move_forward error messages into the Robot commands to then use register() in robot.py. turn left or right has error message: robot not found in grid. This should also be a Grid Error which will be wrapped in register() method.
