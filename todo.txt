Things to keep in mind for later, just incase I forget to account for it: 

Variables: 
 - including expressions when assigning a variable gives an error. Ex: VAR a = (5 + 6) gives an error saying it can't convert '6)' into an int. 
 - You can declare variables while declaring other variables. Ex: VAR a = VAR b = 7 gives both 'a' and 'b' the value 7. This works without the keyword 'VAR' too. 

Types: 
 - Add boolean Types
 - Support for boolean types with logical operators
 - Change default symbol tables for 'TRUE' and 'FALSE' to boolean instead of Number object

If statements: 
 - Change the syntax to have curly braces to wrap expressions and remove 'THEN' keyword
 - Invalid syntax for condition inside if statement is pointing to wrong error

WHILE and FOR loops: 
 - Change while and for loops' syntax to correct syntax
 - Currently FOR and WHILE loops return list by default. Check if we want to change that.
 - Condition node in interpreter might not be updating 

Lexer: 
 - Change lexing process to how POW is done for all comparisn operators. 

Function: 
 - Change function syntax to make Identifier necessary. 
 - Fix the error being overriden for func_def in parser
 - Allow infinite newlines before the left_curly_bracket and skip past them

List: 
 - Change list indexing to start from 0 or 1 (check reference sheet)
 - Concatenate list using + and not *
 - Remove + and / operators for list
 - Make * operator multiply list that many times (how python does it)
 - Change how to get an element from the list
 - Built in list functions 
 - Make printing a list print the square brackets too
 - Fix lists not working with comparisn operators

Built-in Functions: 
 - PRINT
 - PRINT_RET
 - INPUT
 - INPUT_INT
 - CLEAR
 - IS_NUMBER
 - IS_STRING
 - IS_LIST
 - IS_FUNCTION
 - APPEND
 - POP
 - EXTEND

 - Change all these functions so that it matches the CSP reference sheet. Maybe remove some

Comments: 
 - in skip_comment(), if a comment is on a single line with no new line, then while loop will keep calling advance() indefinitely since no new line found
 - in the event that there is a comment that is the only comment in the file with no code following after it, the program detects an empty line as an invalid syntax which throws a confusing error. This error has less to do with the comment function and more to do with the program not ignoring an empty line
