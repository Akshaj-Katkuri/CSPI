Things to keep in mind for later, just incase I forget to account for it: 

Variables: 
 - including expressions when assigning a variable gives an error. Ex: VAR a = (5 + 6) gives an error saying it can't convert '6)' into an int. 
 - You can declare variables while declaring other variables. Ex: VAR a = VAR b = 7 gives both 'a' and 'b' the value 7. This works without the keyword 'VAR' too. 

Types: 
 - Add boolean Types
 - Support for boolean types with logical operators
 - Change default symbol tables for 'TRUE' and 'FALSE' to boolean instead of Number object

If statements: 
 - Change the syntax to have curly braces to wrap expressions and remove 'THEN' keyword

REPEAT-loop: 
 - Add Repeat n times feature
 - Add Repeat until loop

WHILE and FOR loops: 
 - Change while and for loops' syntax to correct syntax
