Things to keep in mind for later, just incase I forget to account for it: 

Variables: 
 - including expressions when assigning a variable gives an error. Ex: VAR a = (5 + 6) gives an error saying it can't convert '6)' into an int. 
 - You can declare variables while declaring other variables. Ex: VAR a = VAR b = 7 gives both 'a' and 'b' the value 7. This works without the keyword 'VAR' too. 

Types: 
 - Add boolean Types
 - Support for boolean types with logical operators
 - Change default symbol tables for 'TRUE' and 'FALSE' to boolean instead of Number object

If statements: 
 - Change the syntax to have curly braces to wrap expressions and remove 'THEN' keyword

REPEAT-loop: 
 - Add Repeat n times feature
 - Add Repeat until loop

WHILE and FOR loops: 
 - Change while and for loops' syntax to correct syntax
 - Currently FOR and WHILE loops return list by default. Check if we want to change that. 

Lexer: 
 - Change lexing process to how POW is done for all comparisn operators. 

Function: 
 - Change function syntax to make Identifier necessary. 
 - Change 

List: 
 - Change list indexing to start from 0 or 1 (check reference sheet)
 - Concatenate list using + and not *
 - Remove + and / operators for list
 - Make * operator multiply list that many times (how python does it)
 - Change how to get an element from the list
 - Built in list functions

Structure: 
 - Break up the big file into smaller pieces, like holy this has horrible organization.
