## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Overview
Computer Science Pseudocode Interpreter (CSPI) is an interpreter for the pseudocode used in AP Computer Science classes. This tool can help both teachers and students practice with the pseudocode in a more interactive way, making exam preparation easier and more engaging. There may be some bugs in the program, so if you do find any, please feel free to create an issue to report them. This README will guide you through setup, usage, and some additional info about the syntax, so I would highly recommend you read through this thoroughly. 


## üåü Highlights

 - Runs pseudocode used in AP Computer Science classes
 - Simple setup and easy to use
 - Provides error messages for debugging
 - Suitable for teaching, classroom practice, and exam preparation
 - Robot feature coming soon


## ‚¨áÔ∏è Installation

1. Head over to the [releases](https://github.com/Akshaj-Katkuri/CSPPI/releases) page.
2. Select the latest release version. 
3. Download the CSPPI .zip file

You can also find a video tutorial here: TODO


## üöÄ Usage

1. In the CSPPI folder, run main.exe.
2. You can now type a line of code in the terminal.
3. To run a file of code, edit the code.txt file and enter the command: ```RUN("code.txt")```
4. You may also create another .txt file in the same folder and run the same command with the name of the text file as a parameter.

## Updating/Uninstalling

To update the program, just uninstall and install the latest release (follow instructions above). To uninstall, just delete the folder (CSPI-v#.#.#) that has main.exe in it. You should also delete the zipped folder. You don't need to uninstall the older versions, but it will help keep it organized if you don't have a bunch of copies of the older versions. 

## Syntax/Documentation

Although most of the syntax is similar to the one in the College Board's [reference sheet](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/media/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-exam-reference-sheet.pdf), there are a few additional things for convenience. If something isn't mentioned here, you can assume it follows the reference sheet. 
### Variables
 - You can copy & paste the assignment operator from the reference sheet ```‚Üê```, or you can just type ```<-``` (less than & minus symbol) which works the same way.
 - For convenience, you can also just use the ```=``` sign.
### Built-In Procedures
In addition to the built-in procedures mentioned in the reference sheet (e.g. DISPLAY(), INPUT()) you can also use these.
 - ```CLEAR()``` This procedure clears the console.
### Errors
Since I'm still working on fixing out all the bugs, there will be bugs. I'm constantly fixing them, so make sure to always stay on the latest release. Here are a few that you might encounter. I will fix these as soon as I can. 
 - Running an empty .txt file throws an error.
### Robot
This feature is coming very soon!
