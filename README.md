## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Overview
This project is an interpreter for the pseudocode used in AP Computer Science classes. It was designed to help both teachers and students practice with the pseudocode in a more interactive way, making exam preparation easier and more engaging. The interpreter is still in beta, so you may encounter bugs. If you do find anyt, please feel free to create an issue to report them. Future updates will include cleaner documentation and more bug fixes. For now, this README will guide you through setup and classroom use, so I would highly recommend you read this thoroughly. 


## üåü Highlights

 - Runs pseudocode used in AP Computer Science classes
 - Simple setup and easy to use
 - Provides error messages for debugging
 - Suitable for teaching, classroom practice, and exam preparation
 - Robot feature coming soon


## ‚¨áÔ∏è Installation

1. Head over to the [releases](https://github.com/Akshaj-Katkuri/CSPPI/releases) page.
2. Select the latest release version. 
3. Download the CSPPI .zip file
4. Extract/Unzip the file to a desired location.


## üöÄ Usage

1. In the CSPPI folder, run main.exe.
2. You can now type a line of code in the terminal.
3. To run a file of code, edit the code.txt file and enter the command: ```RUN("code.txt")```
4. You may also create another .txt file in the same folder and run the same command with the name of the text file as a parameter. 


## Syntax/Documentation

Although most of the syntax is similar to the one in the College Board's [reference sheet](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/media/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-exam-reference-sheet.pdf), there are a few additional things for convenience. 

### Variables
 - You can copy & paste the assignment operator from the reference sheet ```‚Üê```, or you can just type ```<-``` (less than & minus symbol) which works the same way.
 - For convenience, you can also just use the ```=``` sign.

### Built-In Procedures
In addition to the built-in procedures mentioned in the reference sheet (e.g. DISPLAY(), INPUT()) you can also use these.
 - ```CLEAR()``` This clears the console.
