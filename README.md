## ℹ️ Overview
This project is an interpreter for the pseudocode used in AP Computer Science classes. It was designed to help both teachers and students practice with the pseudocode in a more interactive way, making exam preparation easier and more engaging. There may be some bugs in the program, so if you do find any, please feel free to create an issue to report them. This README will guide you through setup, usage, and some additional info about the syntax, so I would highly recommend you read through this thoroughly. 


## 🌟 Highlights

 - Runs pseudocode used in AP Computer Science classes
 - Simple setup and easy to use
 - Provides error messages for debugging
 - Suitable for teaching, classroom practice, and exam preparation
 - Robot feature coming soon


## ⬇️ Installation

1. Head over to the [releases](https://github.com/Akshaj-Katkuri/CSPPI/releases) page.
2. Select the latest release version. 
3. Download the CSPPI .zip file
4. Extract/Unzip the file to a desired location.


## 🚀 Usage

1. In the CSPPI folder, run main.exe.
2. You can now type a line of code in the terminal.
3. To run a file of code, edit the code.txt file and enter the command: ```RUN("code.txt")```
4. You may also create another .txt file in the same folder and run the same command with the name of the text file as a parameter.

## Syntax/Documentation

Although most of the syntax is similar to the one in the College Board's [reference sheet](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/media/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-exam-reference-sheet.pdf), there are a few additional things for convenience. If something isn't mentioned here, you can assume it follows the reference sheet. 
### Variables
 - You can copy & paste the assignment operator from the reference sheet ```←```, or you can just type ```<-``` (less than & minus symbol) which works the same way.
 - For convenience, you can also just use the ```=``` sign.
### Built-In Procedures
In addition to the built-in procedures mentioned in the reference sheet (e.g. DISPLAY(), INPUT()) you can also use these.
 - ```CLEAR()``` This procedure clears the console.
### Robot
This feature is coming very soon!
